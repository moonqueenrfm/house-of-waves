    You called me up, i apologized, you said it's fine<br/>
    I was honest but not vulnerable, when we said goodbye<br/>
    I wanna thank you for wine and walks, all your sage advice<br/>
    The dreams we shared, your love and care<br/>

    Know not when to stop and breathe<br/>
    No matter the wheels fall off, gotta keep steering the car<br/>
    Funny we're excited to drive 12 hours<br/>
    Talk and see the stars<br/>

    Within myself i know my time in the sun will come <br/>
    Even if i don't get there<br/>
    Someone else'll play guitar<br/>
    So I can focus on my message<br/>
    I've got to share it might go far<br/>

    I know I've got to keep moving, keep moving through the changes<br/>
    I know I think too much<br/>
    I know I'll still make it<br/>
     <br/>
    Cause when I trust myself<br/>
    Even if it doesn't sound right<br/>
    At least I feel it for myself<br/>
    And it'll come out fine<br/>
     <br/>
    I've tried settling so very very hard,<br/>
    I find being a good person, hasn't got me very far<br/>
    <br/>

    Do i strike some kind of balance,<br/>
    Between nice and giving hell<br/>

    I don't care if i go very far<br/>
    I'd rather be myself than have sold my soul for art<br/>
    Like Kafka sit and sing for years<br/>
    Right here and on the ground<br/>
     <br/>
    And if i stop thinking so much about myself and my hands i think<br/>
    Something might just come for me<br/>
    Something might just comfort me<br/>
    <br/>
    And i don't know if these tears are fear pain or pleasure<br/>

    Outside of my room, touch on the other parts of my life<br/>

    And i haven't had sex in 3 months<br/>
    I'm sick of that shit and i know it's not good for me too<br/>

    Something might just come out or fall apart<br/>

      in shimmering truth's illusion lies the chase<br/>
       <br/>
      VERSE II🌫️<br/>
      Softly drifting winks of fragrant snow<br/>
      Want to leave this aaaaaahhh can't let go<br/>
      Slyly drifting winks betwixt the scent<br/>
      Our smooth bare skin warm in your bed<br/>
      <br/>
      🌧️CHORUS🌧️<br/>
      Oooohh but we could wait, it's not too long<br/>
      Ambrosia-moments néctars-never late<br/>
      Mmmm honey-'slow sensuous taste<br/>
      In shimmering truth's illusion lies the chase<br/>
       <br/>
      VERSE III🌫️<br/>
      Silky silver rain suspended tease<br/>
      Ask me once once more before i leave<br/>
      I can't promise you I'll stay<br/>
      But forever drips in silver drops of rain<br/>
      PSYCHOUTRO🌨️<br/>
      I can't let go (🔁)<br/>
      Silky silver rain<br/>
      Sing all day<br/>
      Mmmm honey-'slow<br/>
      illusion winks<br/>
      Shimmers truth<br/>
      Come play<br/>

    Flashes of feelings form in my mouth<br/>
    Though I am reelin', words won't come out<br/>
    Your hands on my body flood the tip of my tongue<br/>
    Won't you come over, wanna succumb<br/>
     <br/>
    I've never been sober any time we've kissed<br/>
    Cherish the moments together I've missed<br/>
    Need to create space from dreams in the sand<br/>
    Or you'll see on my face, your whim is my command<br/>

    Once I've said it i can't take it back<br/>

    I've never been sober any time we've kissed<br/>
    Cherish the moments together I've missed<br/>
