        💐VERSE I💐<br/>
        Bbm7                     FmMaj7<br/>
        I saw In Your Eyes was to lay the trap<br/>
        Bbm7                      F7<br/>
        Held tight, ur close goodbye twists the knife<br/>
        Bbm7                     Cm7<br/>
        I know you feinted and feigned innocence<br/>
        Bbm7                     FMaj7<br/>
        From my starving arms to boost your confidence<br/>
        <br/>
        🌷PRECHORUS🌷<br/>
        Ab6                           	Bb7<br/>
        Promises of pictures, sunsets in songs<br/>
        Db                      Ebm9-slide to9<br/>
        we talk as friends but i Ache for your touch<br/>
        <br/>
        🥀CHORUS🥀<br/>
        Fm7                DbM7<br/>
        Can't lift my eyes up From your flowered sleeve<br/>
        Bbm7 			    Cm7<br/>
        Hate to see you walk away But love to watch you leave<br/>
        Fm7                   DbM7 <br/>
        Puppet Master, you can have your fun<br/>

        But please spare the softer feelings of the dumb<br/>
        <br/>
        💐VERSE II💐<br/>
        Paranoia says it's all a ploy to rile your ex<br/>
        My blood in the water’s for competition<br/>
        Why else would you bring rocks to the mountains?<br/>
        Cause i’m dumb and still thank God for fun ideas and loud music<br/>
        <br/>
        🌷PRECHORUS🌷<br/>
        Soft brushes your cheeks on mine<br/>
        near misses of us tantalize,<br/>
        Near kisses by passed-Christmas lights<br/>
        Wish for a repeat of that night but I<br/>
        <br/>
        🥀CHORUS🥀<br/>
        Can't lift my eyes up<br/>
        From your flowered sleeve<br/>
        Hate to see you walk away<br/>
        But love to watch you leave<br/>
        Puppet Master, you can have your fun<br/>
        Please spare the softer feelings of the dumb<br/>
        <br/>
        💐VERSE III💐<br/>
        Gotta tear away before Time Moves Slow<br/>
        Gloss my reactions, shift changes in tone<br/>
        It’s not that I’m unwitting in that i don't know,<br/>
        But rather unwitting in that i can't control<br/>
        <br/>
        🌷PRECHORUS🌷<br/>
        So i burn you, lick my fingers, play dumb<br/>
        we talk as friends but now you Ache for my touch<br/>
        <br/>
        🥀solos over CHORUS🥀<br/>
        <br/>
        💐VERSE IV💐<br/>
        The box flowers purple white and green<br/>
        Why does every bouquet repeat the theme?<br/>
        Funny that your message came at Falling In Love<br/>
        Fiction only dreams of what Truth conjures up<br/>
        <br/>
        🌷PRECHORUS🌷<br/>
        You're smart, you read the frenzy written on my face<br/>
        But i brave the wavy lines by sheer leap of faith<br/>
        <br/>
        🥀CHORUS🥀<br/>
        Can't lift my eyes up<br/>
        From your flowered sleeve<br/>
        Hate to see you walk away<br/>
        But love to watch you leave<br/>
        Puppet Master, you've had your fun<br/>
        Please spare the softer feelings of the dumb<br/>
        <br/>
        Drums lose their shit<br/>
