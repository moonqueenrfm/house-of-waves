        I'm so into you, I just don't understand<br/>
        This certain curse I'm subject to, Always want what I can't have<br/>
        <br/>
        🏜️VERSE I 🏜️<br/>
        E 				     C#7<br/>
        I'm not a sinner I'm just a beginner, Only fall in love for the moment<br/>
        B7					       G#m7<br/>
        But I take ur bait baby, hook line and sinker, Never know quite where I'm going (but I don't mind)<br/>
        <br/>
        🌬️CHORUS🌬️<br/>
        🏜️VERSE II 🏜️<br/>
        Take all your shit with u next time you leave<br/>
        I could spend all day in my reveries<br/>
        Thinkin bout next time you'll come to me<br/>
        Oh nooo it's all tainted by reality<br/>

        Electric shocks when we talk<br/>
        Bb(weirdaugsus+1down)<br/>

        🌬️CHORUS🌬️<br/>
        🏜️VERSE III 🏜️<br/>
        You make me laugh my way to abs<br/>
        Keep your distance, I'm 2 starved 4romance<br/>
        You know me, only take what i can<br/>
        Admire from afar your ceramic hands<br/>
        (goddaaamn)<br/>
        🌬️CHORUS🌬️<br/>
        <br/>
        🏜️VERSE IV 🏜️<br/>
        Gotta quick sketch of you and me<br/>
        Save it for another charcoal day-dream<br/>
        Swear I wouldn't dare do anything<br/>
        It's already you, your kids, and Irene<br/>
        <br/>
