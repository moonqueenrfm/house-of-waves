        The <BlueWordComponent word='winter'/> was coming, yes I was warned<br/>
        I've still got your sweater keeping me warm<br/>
        The <BlueWordComponent word='cold'/> of my impulse leaves me alone<br/>
        We don't talk it's my fault<br/>

        Is this what it feels like to lose a friend?<br/>
        The <BlueWordComponent word='ocean'/>, full moon drives, trips without end<br/>
        Our good times still haunt me, sweet bittersweet<br/>
        "Those are my hippies in the street", you'll always be<br/>

        You called me up, i apologized, you said it's fine<br/>

        I wanna thank you for <BlueWordComponent word='wine'/> and walks, all your sage advice<br/>
        The dreams we shared, your love and care<br/>
