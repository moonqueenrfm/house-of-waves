            🌫️VERSE I🌫️<br />
            Em7.         	EbMaj7.    	Dm7<br />
            Silky silver rain drops on the ground<br />
            DbMaj7.      	Cm7.       	Cbm7<br />
            Sing your name all day, you're not around<br />
            Silky silver rain slides down the street                  <br />
            Always ask about my keys as I'm about to leave<br />
            🌧️CHORUS🌧️<br />
            EbMaj Ab/Bb<br />
            C#11 Ab11 Bb11<br />
            Do you hope i left them at your place<br />
            What would you do if that became the case?<br />
            Midnight mania coaxes us to play<br />
            in shimmering truth's illusion lies the chase<br />
            <br />
            VERSE II🌫️<br />
            Softly drifting winks of fragrant snow<br />
            Want to leave this aaaaaahhh can't let go<br />
            Slyly drifting winks betwixt the scent<br />
            Our smooth bare skin warm in your bed<br />
            <br />
            🌧️CHORUS🌧️<br />
            Oooohh but we could wait, it's not too long<br />
            Ambrosia-moments néctars-never late<br />
            Mmmm honey-'slow sensuous taste<br />
            In shimmering truth's illusion lies the chase<br />
            <br />
            VERSE III🌫️<br />
            Silky silver rain suspended tease<br />
            Ask me once once more before i leave<br />
            I can't promise you I'll stay<br />
            But forever drips in silver drops of rain<br />
            PSYCHOUTRO🌨️<br />
            I can't let go (🔁)<br />
            Silky silver rain<br />
            Sing all day<br />
            Mmmm honey-'slow<br />
            illusion winks<br />
            Shimmers truth<br />
            Come play<br />
