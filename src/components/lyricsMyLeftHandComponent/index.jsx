        Last night thinking so much is killin me<br/>
        Know not when to stop and breathe<br/>
        No matter the wheels fall off, gotta keep steering the car<br/>
        Funny we're excited to drive 12 hours<br/>
        Talk and see the stars<br/>
        <br/>
        Within myself i know my time in the sun will come <br/>
        Even if i don't get there<br/>
        Someone else'll play guitar<br/>
        So I can focus on my message<br/>
        I've got to share it might go far<br/>
        faaaaaaaar faaaar<br/>
        Forget this awful feeling<br/>
        It might just happen<br/>
        <br/>

        I know I've got to keep moving, keep moving through the changes<br/>
        I know I think too much<br/>
        I know I'll still make it<br/>
        <br/>
        Cause when I trust myself<br/>
        Even if it doesn't sound right<br/>
        At least I feel it for myself<br/>
        And it'll come out fine<br/>
        <br/>
        I've tried settling so very very hard,<br/>
        I find being a good person, hasn't got me very far<br/>
        <br/>
        Only when I'm fucked up and stand up for myself<br/>
        Do i strike some kind of balance,<br/>
        Between nice and giving hell<br/>
        <br/>
        GRUNGE FUSION<br/>
        I don't care if i go very far<br/>
        I'd rather be myself than have sold my soul for art<br/>
        Like Kafka sit and sing for years<br/>
        Right here and on the ground<br/>
        <br/>
        And if i stop thinking so much about myself and my hands i think<br/>
        Something might just come for me<br/>
        Something might just comfort me<br/>
        <br/>
        And i don't know if these <BlueWordComponent word='tears'/> are fear pain or pleasure<br/>
        üîú<br/>
        JAZZ FEEL<br/>
        Might eat another shroom popsicle<br/>
        Take more psychedelics i call it<br/>
        Mental health, spiritual wealth<br/>
        a brief reprieve from this emotional <BlueWordComponent word='well'/><br/>
        Can't get away from myself<br/>
        <br/>
        I don't have the hang of life yet<br/>
        I got my <BlueWordComponent word='fishnets'/> on and the art's on the walls, finally<br/>
        And I'm not taking your calls<br/>
        Stop calling me<br/>
        <br/>
        JDILLA<br/>
        My friend told me to self isolate<br/>
        and I know he might have well intentions<br/>
        But part of me thinks that he's full of shit<br/>
        And I wanna go out, get <BlueWordComponent word='drunk'/> n<br/>
        Be with the people and see what life's about<br/>
        <br/>
        There might be so much taint inside but I'm ready to feel the change<br/>
        Outside of my room, touch on the other parts of my life<br/>
        <br/>
        And i haven't had <BlueWordComponent word='sex'/> in 3 months<br/>
        I'm sick of that shit and i know it's not good for me too<br/>
        I don't wanna just fuck somebody and use them like<br/>
        A little mastur-bear-tory tool<br/>
        <br/>
        SAMBA<br/>
        Won't you be my lovely <BlueWordComponent word='sex'/> toy<br/>
        Won't you be my new distraction<br/>
        There's so much spiritual work I've yet to do<br/>
        And I've still gotta do but I'd like to get some action<br/>
        <br/>
        Oooh they just closed the <BlueWordComponent word='bar'/> i used to work at<br/>
        they said it's full of criminals<br/>
        I guess that's just you and me my friend<br/>
        We're all Here full of ourselves<br/>
        <br/>
        Not sure if what we're doing is right or wrong<br/>
        at least I'm trying to see<br/>
        Stop breaking at least<br/>
        I've stopped saying my mom is the worst thing that<br/>
        Title belongs to my ex, fuck you you deserved it<br/>
        <br/>
        And there's nothing more that i can do but let loose<br/>
        Just hope for the best as i try to follow the rules<br/>
        <br/>
        BLASTBEAT/METAL<br/>
        Other people have it out for me,<br/>
        The ones i see in ruts<br/>
        But the wisest thing I've read<br/>
        is that the truth is lived not taught so<br/>
        <br/>
        I might get on your nerves and sound like shit in your ears<br/>
        and in my head but i guess<br/>
        At least I'll still have an empty <BlueWordComponent word='conscience'/><br/>
        <br/>
        32bars STACCATO/purdie SHUFFLE<br/>
        <br/>
        HOUSE DISCO<br/>
        Oooh fuck you, so many words that I've said<br/>
        They're all the truth<br/>
        I've gotta find<br/>
        what truth I've selected<br/>
        <br/>
        My stupid deft fingers can't do wrong with clarity but I'd like to<br/>
        Pass them the secret between you and me<br/>
        But it never happens<br/>
        You're never single at the same time as i am,<br/>
        and now that we both are it seems God has other plans<br/>
        You're never single at the same time as i am,<br/>
        feels like my entire life is a collection of other people's<br/>
        Missed Quonnections<br/>
        <br/>
        TRAP BEAT/REGGAE<br/>
        I never took part in all the truths I could have shared<br/>
        It took, 20 years, 28 years<br/>
        <br/>
        üîú<br/>
        So much thinking in my head it doesn't let my hell speak<br/>
        Read the truth that lies within me<br/>
        <br/>
        When i close my eyes and follow through my heart<br/>
        Something might just come out or fall apart<br/>
        <br/>
        I've always been afraid of the destructive power of the truth<br/>
        The matter itself and the method i had chosen<br/>
        You can always count on a poet to tell the truth<br/>
        I'm somewhat of a poet, i smoke sages too<br/>
        See, the power of memory:<br/>
        It doesn't matter cause you're not gonna remember<br/>
        listen to me it's not me it's you<br/>
        <br/>
        Stop Letting the intellect rule your heart<br/>
        Maybe step into the wisdom of your body you'll go far<br/>

        TOM GROOVE<br/>
        Give her slack<br/>
        It never comes as easy for me as it does for you<br/>
        I might feel so much jealousy in my heart<br/>
        It's only because all the times I've told the truth<br/>
        I've been turned away and torn apart<br/>
        I'll just gonna wait for my time in the sun<br/>
        Got to keep believing, oooh here it comes!<br/>
        <br/>
        I was cine-mad<br/>
        I'd like to sing pretty things but i<br/>
        Have a cache to clear<br/>
        So much pain before I d(ie)o<br/>
        <br/>
        Learn to practice more<br/>
        And let the roses come my way<br/>
        Cause I've got to learn to trust myself<br/>
        learn to look away<br/>
        <br/>
        ACTUAL FUSION<br/>
        Soft folding in to the glory of my mind<br/>
        She‚Äôs always going be back trying to keep me from flying high<br/>
        As i look at all my books<br/>
        I think of all the thieves the liars and the crooks<br/>
        The ones who take from me and say i am not enough<br/>
        But i know that iiiii<br/>
        Just can't give up<br/>
        <br/>
        Of my flight i<br/>
        Get this sort of peace RIT<br/>
        Slow myself down<br/>
        And love to feel release<br/>

        PROGRESSIVE 5/4<br/>
        FAUX END-HALF TIME<br/>
        You are prosperous<br/>
        I live to see the light<br/>
        That's reflected in your <BlueWordComponent word='eyes'/><br/>
        <br/>
        When you catch me staring at a mic<br/>
        Finally see myself as more than just a mind<br/>
        <br/>
        Oh I'm always almost halfway there<br/>
        Cause one half of the work is knowing<br/>
        And the other half is really<br/>
        caring to do the motherfuckin woooork<br/>
