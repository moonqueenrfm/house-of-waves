        Flashes of feelings form in my mouth<br/>
        Though I am reelin', words won't come out<br/>
        Your hands on my body flood the tip of my tongue<br/>
        Won't you come over, wanna succumb<br/>
        <br/>
        I've never been sober any time we've kissed<br/>
        Cherish the moments together I've missed<br/>
        Need to create space from dreams in the sand<br/>
        Or you'll see on my face, your whim is my command<br/>

        Once I've said it i can't take it back<br/>
